<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Now that we are done with the basics, let's work on perfecting some details.</p>

<p>In the previous stage, if the user entered the same letter twice, the program reduced the number of remaining attempts regardless of whether this was a correct letter or not. This doesnâ€™t seem fair to the player, does it? They gain no additional information about the situation on the field yet the program still reduces their remaining attempts. Let's fix it!</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>If the user enters the same letter twice, then the program should output <code class="java">You've already guessed this letter</code> . This message should also be printed if the user inputs a letter that doesn't appear in the word. The number of attempts shouldn't be decreased in this case. </li>
	<li>Also, you should check to make sure the player entered an English lowercase letter. If not, the program should print <code class="java">Please enter a lowercase English letter</code> . </li>
	<li>You should also check if the player entered exactly one letter. If not, the program should print <code class="java">You should input a single letter</code> . Remember that zero is also not one!</li>
	<li>Note that none of these three errors should reduce the number of remaining attempts!</li>
</ol>

<p><div class="alert alert-warning">Please, make sure that your program's output formatting precisely follows the output formatting in the example. Pay attention to the empty lines between tries and in the end.</div></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the output.</p>
