<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Let's make the game iterative. Now it's time to make the game resemble the classic version of Hangman a bit more. The player should now guess letters in the word instead of typing the entire word all at once. If the player guesses a letter, it should be uncovered in the word. For now, start by building the defeat condition and add 8 tries to guess a letter that appears in the word. When the player runs out of attempts, the game ends.</p>

<p>Later we will determine the winning conditions, but in this stage, let's just see how well our player guesses the word on each attempt.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Now your game should work as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A player has <strong>exactly 8 tries</strong> and enters letters. Nothing changes if a player has more tries left but they have already guessed the word.</li>
	<li>If the letter doesn't appear in the word, the computer takes one try away â€“ even if the user has already guessed this letter.</li>
	<li>If the player doesn't have any more attempts, the game should end and the program should show a losing message. Otherwise, the player can continue to input letters.</li>
	<li>Also, the word should be selected from our list: <code class="java">'python', 'java', 'kotlin', 'javascript'</code>, so that your program can be tested more reliably.</li>
</ol>

<p><div class="alert alert-warning">Please, make sure that your program's output formatting precisely follows the example. Pay attention to the empty lines between tries and at the end.</div></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the output.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
