<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The most recent version of the game is not so much fun, since we still don’t have a way to handle the player's victory. The player has 8 attempts to guess letters, and the number of remaining attempts decreases after each try even if the player guesses correctly.</p>

<p>In this next version, a player may get a lot of attempts because they are limited only by the number of mistakes they make. A player can be mistaken 8 times. They win when they have guessed <strong>all</strong> the letters and still have at least one try. If the player uses their last try and actually guesses the word, then they’ve won!</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>The player starts the game with 8 "lives", which is to say, our player can input a wrong letter 8 times.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Print <code class="java">That letter does not appear in the word</code> and reduce the number of remaining attempts if the word selected by the program doesn't contain this letter.</li>
	<li>Print <code class="java">No improvements</code> and reduce the attempts count if the selected word contains this letter but the user has already tried guessing it.</li>
	<li>The number of remaining attempts should be decreased only if there are no letters to uncover.</li>
</ol>

<p><div class="alert alert-warning">Please, make sure that your program's output formatting precisely follows the output formatting in the example. Pay attention to the empty lines between tries and at the end.</div></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the output.</p>
