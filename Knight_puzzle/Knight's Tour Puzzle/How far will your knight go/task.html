<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Try and beat this puzzle! Your program should now allow multiple moves and mark the squares you have already visited.</p>

<p>The task is quite hard, and you may want to use Warnsdorff's rule to complete it. Using the rule alone doesn't guarantee that you will win, so you can dismiss it if you prefer. Bear in mind that not every board may have a solution!</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, you should modify your program to do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Set up a board.</li>
	<li>Display the board status and the number of possible moves using Warnsdorff's rule.</li>
	<li>Prompt the player for the knight's move.</li>
	<li>Check whether the move is valid. If not, ask the player for another move.</li>
	<li>Move the knight and mark the position with an '<code class="java">X</code>'. Mark the visited squares with an '<code class="java">*</code>'.</li>
	<li>Repeat the above step until there are no more possible moves.</li>
	<li>If the player visits every square without repetition, congratulate them on their victory!</li>
	<li>If the player loses, print the number of moves they made.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please, try to organize your code well, split it into functions and methods, and make them reusable: the difficulty of the next stage greatly depends on this. Its implementation will involve the feature of solving the puzzle automatically. This is not an easy task if your code isn't split into functions.  </p>
