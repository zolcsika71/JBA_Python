<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The knight's tour problem uses a chessboard and a knight. Don't worry, you won't need to know the chess basics for this project, you only need to know how a knight moves on the board.</p>

<p>A standard chess board is an 8x8 square on which the chess pieces are placed. For this project, we will use a coordinate system (x,y) to label each square on the chessboard, where (1,1) is the bottom left, and (8,8) is the top right.</p>

<p>The knight is a chess piece. It moves in an L-shape and can jump over other pieces. It has to move 2 squares horizontally and 1 square vertically, or 2 squares vertically and 1 square horizontally.</p>

<p>The rules of the knight's tour are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The knight can start at any square.</li>
	<li>The knight must visit every square by moving in the L-shape.</li>
	<li>The knight can visit each square only once.</li>
	<li>The knight can finish anywhere on the board. This is called an 'open' tour of the board.</li>
	<li>You win if you visit every square on the board.</li>
	<li>You lose if you fail to visit every square only once without revisiting it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Let's get started by setting up the puzzle:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Ask the user for the knight's starting position.</li>
	<li>If the user input contains non-integer numbers you should print <code class="java">Invalid dimensions!</code>.</li>
	<li>If the user input contains more than 2 numbers you should print <code class="java">Invalid dimensions!</code>.</li>
	<li>If the user input numbers out of bounds of the game field you should print <code class="java">Invalid dimensions!</code>.</li>
	<li>Display the 8x8 chessboard with the knight in this position. You should display a frame around the board and mark the column and row numbers. You should use an underscore <code class="java">_</code> for an empty cell with a space in between them, and an <code class="java">X</code> for the knight's position.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
