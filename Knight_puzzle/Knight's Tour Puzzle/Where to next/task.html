<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Once the board is set up, let's see where our knight can move.</p>

<p>The knight moves in an L-shape, so it has to move 2 squares horizontally and 1 square vertically, or 2 squares vertically and 1 square horizontally.</p>

<p>Here are two examples showing how the knight can move. In the first example, there are 8 possible moves for the knight:</p>

<p>In the second example, there are only 3 possible moves since the knight cannot leave the board:</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, you should modify your program to do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Check all 8 possible moving directions from the starting position.</li>
	<li>If the move is possible, mark the landing position with the letter 'O'.</li>
	<li>If the move is not possible, no action is required.</li>
</ol>

<p>Don't forget that column and row numbers, as well as the knight position and the 'O' letter for the landing position, should be aligned to the right. For example, for a three-symbols long placeholder, the landing position should look like <code class="java">  O</code>.</p>

<p>Please, don't forget about functional decomposition: splitting your code into reusable functions is very important for the next stages.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

Enter the knight's starting position: &gt; 4 2

Here are the possible moves:
