 <body>
  <p>A kindergarten in Berlin may open a certain amount of new groups. Their names are in the list <code class="java">groups = ['1A', '1B', '1C', '2A', '2B', '2C', '3A', '3B', '3C']</code>. Children are divided into groups starting from <code class="java">1A</code> and ending with <code class="java">3C</code>. However, if there are not so many kids, only the first groups in the list will be filled up.</p> 
  <p>From the first line in the input, read the number of groups that will be filled. And in the next lines â€” the number of children in each group in the order in which they are listed in the <code class="java">groups</code>. If the first number is less than 9 (and there are less than nine values after it), it means that the last groups are not starting this year.</p> 
  <p>Create a dictionary, where group names will be written as keys, and the number of kids in the group as values.<br> For unfilled groups, assign the value <code class="java">None</code>. Finally, print the filled dictionary.</p>
