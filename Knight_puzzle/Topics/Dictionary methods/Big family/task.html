  <p>Let's say it's a wedding day, and two happy people are getting married. </p> 
  <p>We have a dictionary <code class="language-python">first_family</code>, which contains the names of the wife's family members. For example: </p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">first_family = {"wife": "Janet", "wife's mother": "Katie", "wife's father": "George"}</code></pre> 
  <p>And a similar dictionary <code class="language-python">second_family</code> for the husband's family:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">second_family = {"husband": "Leon", "husband's mother": "Eva", "husband's father": "Gaspard", "husband's sister": "Isabelle"}</code></pre> 
  <p>Create a new dictionary that would contain information about the big new family. Similarly with the ones above, family members should be keys and their names should be values. First, update the new dictionary with elements from <code class="language-python">first_family</code> and then from <code class="language-python">second_family</code>. <strong>Print</strong> it out.</p>
