<h2>Multi-line programs</h2>

 <body>
  <p>We hope you have already learned how to write simple Python programs consisting of a single line that just prints a text. However, real programs contain a significant number of lines: from tens and hundreds for small scripts to thousands and even more for large projects. So, in this lesson, you will write programs that print multiple lines.</p> 
  <p>Let's consider an example, the following code prints exactly three strings, each on a new line:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">print("I")
print("know")
print("Python")</code></pre> 
  <p>The output is:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">I
know
Python</code></pre> 
  <p>You can run this example <a target="_blank" href="https://repl.it/languages/python3" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Link: https://repl.it/languages/python3">here</a> or locally if you have already installed Python on your computer.</p> 
  <p>There are other ways to print the same text using just one function call. We will consider them in the next topics.</p> 
  <p>The <code class="language-python">print</code> function also allows you to print an empty line with no string specified:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">print("I")
print()
print("know")
print()
print("Python")</code></pre> 
  <p>Here's the output:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">I

know

Python</code></pre> 
  <p>However, skipping the line will have no effect:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">print("And")

print("you?")</code></pre> 
  <p>The output is:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">And
you?</code></pre> 
  <p>Now it's time to solve some problems.</p>
