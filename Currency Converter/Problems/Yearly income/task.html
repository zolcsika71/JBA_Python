<h2>Yearly income</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>The file <strong>salary.txt </strong>contains a monthly salary of all employees in the company. Assume that the monthly salary is fixed and each employee is mentioned once. So, each number (an integer) written on a separate line corresponds to a particular employee:</p> 
  <p><samp>3500<br> 4780<br> 6666<br> ...</samp></p> 
  <p>According to the example, the first worker gets <em>3,500</em> per month, the second one <em>4,780</em> and the third <em>6,666</em>, etc.</p> 
  <p>Calculate how much each employee earns per year and save their yearly income to a file <strong>salary_year.txt.</strong> Similarly to the original file, each income should be on a separate line. Preserve the order as it helps identify an employee.</p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-784').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-784" style="display:none;">
   Files are read and written as strings, so don't forget to do necessary conversions!
