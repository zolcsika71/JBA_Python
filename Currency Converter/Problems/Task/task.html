<h2>Task</h2>

  <p>Below you can see the class <code class="language-python">Task</code>. Any task has a description and a person responsible for finishing this task. In our class, these aspects are represented by instance attributes <code class="language-python">description</code> and <code class="language-python">team</code>.</p> 
  <p>Sometimes we may want to combine tasks together (that is, add them up). Define the method <code class="language-python">__add__</code> that:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>combines the descriptions of two tasks. Two descriptions should be on different lines;</li> 
   <li>combines the two teams responsible for different tasks. They should be separated by a comma and a whitespace.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Here's an example:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">task1 = Task("Finish the assignment.", "Kate")
task2 = Task("Prepare the project for class.", "James, Ann")

task3 = task1 + task2
task3.description  # "Finish the assignment.\nPrepare the project for class."
task3.team  # "Kate, James, Ann"</code></pre>
