<h2>Correct documentation</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>When writing documentation, it is important to check whether this documentation really corresponds to what the object does.</p> 
  <p>We implemented the <code class="java">calculate()</code> function and created a docstring for it. Check all the <em>value types</em> in the documentation. Is everything right? You need to change just one word in the description and run the code again.</p>

<b>Caution</b><br><br>
You may see errors in your code or execution results due to missing context. Donâ€™t worry about it, just write the solution and press Check.
