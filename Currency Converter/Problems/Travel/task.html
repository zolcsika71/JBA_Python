 <body>
  <p>There's a file<strong> countries.txt </strong>that contains a list of the countries Kate has been to. For example:</p> 
  <p><samp>France<br> China<br> Brazil</samp></p> 
  <p>During her last trip, she has visited Turkey for the first time. Add Turkey to the <strong>countries.txt </strong>file.</p> 
  <p>Kate will not give up traveling, so it would be reasonable to add a newline character at the end.</p> 
  <p>Don't forget to close the file!</p>
