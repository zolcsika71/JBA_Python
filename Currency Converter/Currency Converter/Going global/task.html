<h2>Description</h2>

<p>You can convert your conicoins into dollars, cool. What if you want a different currency? What if you're going to Morocco tomorrow? You'll need some dirhams, that's for sure. We need to improve our converter.</p>

<p>Take the imaginary exchange rates below and modify your program to work with 5 different currencies:</p>

<ul>
	<li>RUB – Russian Ruble; 1 conicoin = 2.98 RUB;</li>
	<li>ARS – Argentine Peso; 1 conicoin = 0.82 ARS;</li>
	<li>HNL – Honduran Lempira; 1 conicoin = 0.17 HNL;</li>
	<li>AUD – Australian Dollar; 1 conicoin = 1.9622 AUD;</li>
	<li>MAD – Moroccan Dirham; 1 conicoin = 0.208 MAD.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take the number of conicoins as the user input, сonvert it to the specified currencies, and round the result to two decimals using the Python built-in function. Notice that the input number can have a fractional part!</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Get the number of conicoins from user input.</li>
	<li>Print how much you will get in all five currencies mentioned above.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
