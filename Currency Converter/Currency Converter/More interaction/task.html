<h2>Description</h2>

<p>We are going to make our program more complex. As you remember, the conicoin rate was fixed in the previous stage. But in the real world, things are different. It's time to write a program that takes your conicoins and an up-to-date conicoin exchange rate, then counts how many dollars you would get, and prints the result.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Get the number of conicoins from the user input.</li>
	<li>Get the exchange rate from the user input.</li>
	<li>Calculate and print the result.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Please, enter the number of conicoins you have: &gt; 13
Please, enter the exchange rate: &gt; 2
The total amount of dollars: 26</code></pre>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Please, enter the number of conicoins you have: &gt; 128
Please, enter the exchange rate: &gt; 3.21
The total amount of dollars: 410.88</code></pre>
