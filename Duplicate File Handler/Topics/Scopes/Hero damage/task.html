   Let's now take a look at how 
  <code class="java">global</code> variables can help us to save information between different function calls.
  <p></p> 
  <p>Imagine you're writing a program for some video game: you need to calculate the damage that the main hero deals to its enemies in one hit. The current damage is stored in the global variable <code class="java">hero_damage</code>. Use the power of this global and write three functions that change its value:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><code class="java">double_damage()</code> doubles the damage of the hero</li> 
   <li><code class="java">disarmed()</code> makes the damage equal to 10% of the current value</li> 
   <li><code class="java">power_potion()</code> adds 100 damage points</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The functions are already declared. You only need to replace <code class="java">pass</code>keyword with some code of yours. </p> 
  <p>Don't output or return anything, just write the body of the functions. Remember how we can change the value of a global variable.</p>
