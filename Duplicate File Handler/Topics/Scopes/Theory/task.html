<h2>Scopes</h2>

 <body>
  <p>A<strong> scope</strong> is a part of the program where a certain variable can be reached by its name. The scope is a very important concept in programming because it defines the visibility of a name within the code block.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Global vs. Local</h2> 
  <p>When you define a variable it becomes either <strong>global</strong> or <strong>local</strong>. If a variable is defined at the top-level of the module it is considered global. That means that you can refer to this variable from every code block in your program. Global variables can be useful when you need to share state information or some configuration between different functions. For example, you can store the name of a current user in a global variable and then use it where needed. It makes your code easier to change: in order to set a new user name you will only have to change a single variable.</p> 
  <p>Local variables are created when you define them in the body of a function. So its name can only be resolved inside the current function's scope. It lets you avoid issues with side-effects that may happen when using global variables.</p> 
  <p>Consider the example to see the difference between global and local variables:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">phrase = "Let it be"

def global_printer():
    print(phrase)  # we can use phrase because it's a global variable

global_printer()  # Let it be is printed
print(phrase)  # we can also print it directly

phrase = "Hey Jude"

global_printer()  # Hey Jude is now printed because we changed the value of phrase

def printer():
    local_phrase = "Yesterday"
    print(local_phrase)  # local_phrase is a local variable

printer()  # Yesterday is printed as expected

print(local_phrase)  # NameError is raised</code></pre> 
  <p>Thus, a global variable can be accessed both from the top-level of the module and the function's body. On the other hand, a local variable is only visible inside the nearest scope and cannot be accessed from the outside.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">LEGB rule</h2> 
  <p>A variable resolution in Python follows the <strong>LEGB rule</strong>. That means that the interpreter looks for a name in the following order:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><strong>Locals</strong>. Variables defined within the function body and not declared global.</li> 
   <li><strong>Enclosing</strong>. Names of the local scope in all enclosing functions from inner to outer.</li> 
   <li><strong>Global</strong><strong>s</strong>. Names defined at the top-level of a module or declared global with a <code class="language-python">global</code> keyword.</li> 
   <li><strong>Built-in</strong>. Any built-in name in Python.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>Let's consider an example to illustrate the LEGB rule:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">x = "global"
def outer():
    x = "outer local"
    def inner():
        x = "inner local"
        def func():
            x = "func local"
            print(x)
        func()
    inner()

outer()  # "func local"</code></pre> 
  <p>When the <code class="language-python">print()</code> function inside the <code class="language-python">func()</code> is called the interpreter needs to resolve the name <code class="language-python">x</code>. It'll first look at the innermost variables and will search for the local definition of <code class="language-python">x</code> in <code class="language-python">func()</code> function. In the case of the code above, the interpreter will find the local <code class="language-python">x</code> in <code class="language-python">func()</code> successfully and print its value, <code class="language-python">'func local'</code>. But what if there isn't a definition of <code class="language-python">x</code> in <code class="language-python">func()</code>? Then, the interpreter will move outward and turn to <code class="language-python">inner()</code> function. Check out the following example:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">x = "global"
def outer():
    x = "outer local"
    def inner():
        x = "inner local"
        def func():
            print(x)
        func()
    inner()

outer()  # "inner local"</code></pre> 
  <p>As you see, the name <code class="language-python">x</code> was resolved in <code class="language-python">inner()</code> function, since the value <code class="language-python">"inner local"</code> was printed. </p> 
  <p>If we remove the definition of <code class="language-python">x</code> from the <code class="language-python">inner()</code> function as well and run the code again, the interpreter will continue the search among the <code class="language-python">outer()</code> locals in the same fashion. If we keep deleting the lines of code defining <code class="language-python">x</code>, the interpreter will move on to <code class="language-python">outer()</code> locals, then globals, and then built-in names. In case there is no matching built-in name, an error will be raised. Look at the example where the global definition of <code class="language-python">x</code> is reached by the interpreter:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">x = "global"
def outer():
    def inner():
        def func():
            print(x)
        func()
    inner()

outer()  # "global"</code></pre> 
  <p>Don't forget about LEGB rule if you plan on using enclosing functions. </p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Keywords "nonlocal" and "global"</h2> 
  <p>We already mentioned one way to assign a global variable: make a definition at the top-level of a module. But there is also a special keyword <code class="language-python">global</code> that allows us to declare a variable global inside a function's body.</p> 
  <p>You can't change the value of a global variable inside the function without using the <code class="language-python">global</code> keyword:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">x = 1
def print_global():
    print(x)

print_global()  # 1

def modify_global():
    print(x)
    x = x + 1

modify_global()  # UnboundLocalError</code></pre> 
  <p>An error is raised because we are trying to assign to a local variable <code class="language-python">x</code> the expression that contains <code class="language-python">x</code> and the interpreter can't find this variable in a local scope. To fix this error, we need to declare <code class="language-python">x</code> global:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">x = 1
def global_func():
    global x
    print(x)
    x = x + 1

global_func()  # 1
global_func()  # 2
global_func()  # 3</code></pre> 
  <p>When <code class="language-python">x</code> is global you can increment its value inside the function.</p> 
  <p><code class="language-python">nonlocal</code> keyword lets us assign to variables in the outer (but not global) scope:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">def func():
    x = 1
    def inner():
        x = 2
        print("inner:", x)
    inner()
    print("outer:", x)

def nonlocal_func():
    x = 1
    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x = 2
        print("inner:", x)
    inner()
    print("outer:", x)

func()  # inner: 2
        # outer: 1

nonlocal_func()  # inner: 2
                 # outer: 2</code></pre> 
  <p>Though <code class="language-python">global</code> and <code class="language-python">nonlocal</code> are present in the language, they are not often used in practice, because these keywords make programs less predictable and harder to understand.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Why do we need scopes?</h2> 
  <p>First of all, why does Python need the distinction between global and local scope? Well, from the experience of some other programming languages that do not have <em>local </em>scopes it became clear, that using only global scope is highly inconvenient: when every variable is accessible from every part of the code, a whole bunch of bugs is inevitable. The longer the code, the more difficult it becomes to remember all the variables' names and not accidentally change the value of the variable that you were supposed to keep untouched. Therefore, Python saves you the trouble by allowing you to "isolate" some variables from the rest of the code when you split it into functions. </p> 
  <p>On the other hand, why do we need <em>global </em>scope then? Well, as was already mentioned above, global scope is one of the easiest ways to retain information between function calls: while local variables disappear the moment the function returns, global variables remain and help functions to transfer the necessary data between each other. Similarly, global variables can enable the communication between more complex processes, such as threads in multithreaded applications. </p> 
  <h2>Summary</h2> 
  <p>In this topic, we've found out the difference between global and local variables and "nonlocal" and "global" keywords, learned the LEGB rule, and how scopes can be helpful in practice. Hope you'll find this new knowledge useful!</p>
