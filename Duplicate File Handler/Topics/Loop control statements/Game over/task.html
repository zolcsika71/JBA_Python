 <body>
  <p>In online test games, there is usually a limited number of lives: if, for example, you make 3 mistakes, you lose and do not continue with the game. Imagine you are trying to implement that system to an online test game.</p> 
  <p><strong>The input format:</strong></p> 
  <p>A line with <strong>N</strong> user answers in a game separated by a space: <strong>C </strong>for a correct answer and <strong> I </strong>for an incorrect answer.</p> 
  <p>The user always has <strong>3</strong> lives. The user loses when they make their third mistake. If the user makes no more than 2 mistakes, they win.</p> 
  <p><strong>The output format:</strong></p> 
  <p>If the user loses the game, print "<strong>Game over" </strong>and their score (the number of correct answers). If the user wins, print <strong>"You won" </strong> and their score. The message should be printed without quotation marks. The message and the score should be printed on separate lines.</p>
