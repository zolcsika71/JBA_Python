<h2>Heron's formula</h2>

  <p>Many years ago, when Paul went to school, he did not like using Heron's formula to calculate the area of a triangle, because he considered it to be very complex. One day he decided to help all the students in his school by writing a program that calculated the area of a triangle by its three sides.</p> 
  <p>However, there was a problem: as Paul did not like the formula, he did not memorize it. Help him finish this act of kindness and write the program following Heron's formula:</p> 
  <p><span class="math-tex">\[ S=\sqrt{p(p - a)(p - b)(p - c)}\]</span> where <span class="math-tex">\( p=\dfrac{a + b + c}2 \)</span> is a half-perimeter of the triangle. On the input, the program has integers, and the output should be a real number corresponding to the area of the triangle.</p> 
  <p>Do <em>NOT</em> round the result.</p>
