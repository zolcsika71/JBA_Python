  <p>Ruth goes shopping today, so she is busy making a shopping list.</p> 
  <p>She wrote down things that she would like to buy at the grocery store. All of these things are in the given <code class="java">shopping_list</code> variable, it has already been created.</p> 
  <p>When sneaking a look at the fridge, she noticed that there was some <strong><em>milk </em></strong>left and changed her mind about buying a new one. It got crossed out of the list. And, finally, she added a <code class="java">"brownie"</code>, and it became the last item Ruth had put on the list.</p> 
  <p>Now you try to remove <code class="java">"milk"</code> from the given variable <code class="java">shopping_list</code>, and add <code class="java">"brownie"</code> to it.</p> 
  <p><em>DON'T</em> print the results.</p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-784').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-784" style="display:none;">
   You can add an item with 
   <code class="java">list.append()</code> and delete it with 
   <code class="java">list.remove()</code>.
  </div>
