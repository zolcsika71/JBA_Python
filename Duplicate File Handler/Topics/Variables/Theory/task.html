<h2>Variables</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>You can use a programming language like Python to do calculations or to work with constant values like strings. Is it enough for you, though? When writing real programs, you usually need to <strong>store values</strong> or evaluation results in computer memory.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is a variable?</h2> 
  <p><strong>Variable</strong> is a named place where you can store some value and access the value later. Imagine a <em>box</em> where you keep something. That's a variable.</p> 
  <p>For example, you calculate something and would like to reuse the formula for some other numbers. In this case, you operate only these "boxes".</p> 
  <p>In general, it's a good practice to give a variable a name that describes its content.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Defining a variable and assigning values</h2> 
  <p>You can keep almost anything in variables just by assigning the new value for a named variable with an equal sign. Also, following <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">PEP 8</a>, one space before and after the assignment sign is considered good practice.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">day_of_week = "Monday"</code></pre> 
  <p>Now you have a string type value <code class="language-python">"Monday"</code> stored in computer memory. You can retrieve the value by calling the variable name.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">print(day_of_week)  # Monday</code></pre> 
  <p>Now, <code class="language-python">day_of_week</code> stores a value of the <code class="language-python">str</code> type.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">print(type(day_of_week))  # &lt;class 'str'&gt;</code></pre> 
  <p>You can always assign a new value to a defined variable:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">day_of_week = "Tuesday"</code></pre> 
  <p>Now, you will retrieve another value:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">print(day_of_week)  # Tuesday</code></pre> 
  <p>It is possible to assign the value of one variable to another variable:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">a = 10
b = a  # b is 10</code></pre> 
  <p>If you haven't defined a variable within the scope of your code, you'll see an error:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">print(month_name)  # NameError: name 'month_name' is not defined</code></pre> 
  <p>Python allows you to assign values of different types to the same variable. Let's assign the string name of a month to a variable and print its type.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">month = "December"
print(type(month))  # &lt;class 'str'&gt;</code></pre> 
  <p>Now, let's assign the number of this month to the variable and print its type again.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">month = 12
print(type(month))  # &lt;class 'int'&gt;</code></pre> 
  <p>This works because Python is a language with <strong>dynamic typing.</strong></p>

   Please, do not overuse it! If your code is quite long, you might forget that you have changed the type. And this is the breeding ground for errors!
  </div>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Naming rules</h2> 
  <p>As we mentioned above, each variable has a specific name that distinguishes it from other variables. There are some rules for naming variables that you should follow:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Names are case-sensitive (<code class="language-python">month</code> is not the same as <code class="language-python">Month</code>);</li> 
   <li>A name begins with a letter or an underscore, followed by letters, digits, and underscores (e.g. <code class="language-python">user_name</code>, <code class="language-python">score1</code>, <code class="language-python">_count</code>);</li> 
   <li>A name cannot start with a digit (for example, <code class="language-python">2q</code> is not a valid name);</li> 
   <li>A name must not be a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">keyword</a>.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
   Do not break these rules; otherwise, your program will not work.
  </div>
