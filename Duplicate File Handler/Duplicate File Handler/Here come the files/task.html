<h5>Theory</h5>

<p>Let's get straight to the point. For our task, we need the <code class="java">os.walk</code> method. The Tutorial's Point <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/os_walk.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">guide</a> can shed some light on how to use it.</p>

<h5>Description</h5>

<p>A computer is a great thing. It helps us store and manage tons of information. Every user knows how to work with folders. In this step, we will learn how to get a list of files and folders within a specific directory.</p>

<ul>
</ul>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Accept a command-line argument that is a root directory with files and folders. Print <code class="java">Directory is not specified</code> if there is no command-line argument;</li>
	<li>Iterate over folders and print file names with their paths. The direction of the slashes in the printed out paths do not matter. Tests are platform independent, so different style of slashes ("/" or "\") are valid.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Example</h5>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<p>Suppose, you have the following set of files and folders:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">+---[root_folder]
    |
    +---wall.png
    +---pass.txt
    +---[docs]
    |   |
    |   +---project.py
    |   +---calc.xls
    |   +---tutorial.mp4
    |   +---[res]
    |       |
    |       +---data.json
    |   +---[output]
    |       |
    |       +---result.json
    +---[masterpiece]
        |
        +---rick_astley_never_gonna_give_you_up.mp3</code></pre>

<p>Program output: </p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; python handler.py root_folder

root_folder/wall.png
root_folder/pass.txt
root_folder/docs/project.py
root_folder/docs/calc.xls
