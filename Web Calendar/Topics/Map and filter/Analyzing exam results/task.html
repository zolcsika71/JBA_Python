  <p>Imagine you work at the admission office of some university, and you need to select successful applications for the next academic year.</p> 
  <p>All candidates took entry exams in Maths, Physics, and English. Results are stored in the lists <code class="java">scores_maths</code>, <code class="java">scores_physics</code> and <code class="java">scores_english</code> respectively.</p> 
  <p>To enter the university, a student must get <em>at least</em> 270 points in total.</p> 
  <p>How many students will be admitted?</p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-548').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-548" style="display:none;">
    First, compute the overall score for each student. Then, filter out those who didn't get enough points and print the length of the remaining list.
