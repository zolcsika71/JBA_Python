 <body>
  <p>Your friend started writing an algorithm that takes a list of names and counts the number of names starting with a capital letter. Your friend is still learning Python and doesn't know how to complete this algorithm. Help your friend finish the implementation. You only need to finish the algorithm function, you do NOT need to work with the input data!</p> 
  <p>Don't forget to think about corner cases!</p>
