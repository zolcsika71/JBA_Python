<h2>Fish in the water</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>The class <strong>Fish </strong>stores information about all the fish in some aquarium. One of the class attributes is <strong>n_fish </strong>which corresponds to the number of fish that have been created (and are now in the aquarium).</p> 
  <p>In the code below, you can see that there's <strong>greg, </strong>the only fish that has been created so far. Update the value of <strong>n_fish </strong>in the correct way.</p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-431').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-431" style="display:none;">
   Remember that integer is an immutable type and class attributes of this kind have to be accessed through the class itself so that changes affect all instances of the class.
