<h2>Complex numbers 2.0</h2>

 <body>
  <p>In this topic, we've defined the class <code class="java">ComplexNumber</code> and several magic methods for this class. However, it makes sense to define a couple of other methods so that we can use this class to its full potential.</p> 
  <p>We need methods for subtraction and division.</p> 
  <p><strong>Subtraction</strong></p> 
  <p>If we have 2 complex numbers <span class="math-tex">\(x = a + bi\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(y = c + di\)</span> , then <span class="math-tex">\(x - y\)</span> will equal <span class="math-tex">\((a - c) + (b - d)i\)</span>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Division</strong></p> 
  <p>For division, we need to calculate the reciprocal of a complex number. If <span class="math-tex">\(x = a + bi\)</span>, then <span class="math-tex">\({1 \over x} = {a \over a^2 + b^2} - {b \over a^2 + b^2}i\)</span>.</p> 
  <p><span class="math-tex">\({x \over y} \)</span>can then be represented as <span class="math-tex">\(x * {1 \over y}\)</span>.</p>
