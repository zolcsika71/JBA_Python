<h2>Description</h2>

<p>You have planned a dinner with your friends today. It's the right time to add them to your program. You need to be sure how many friends are joining you for dinner including you.</p>

<p>The idea is to take names from user input. Store them in a dictionary. </p>

<p>For example, if five friends are joining including you, you need to add five people to the dictionary so that you can access/update the corresponding bill value later.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage your program should perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Take user input â€” how many people want to join, including the user;</li>
	<li>In case of an invalid number of people (zero or negative), <code class="java">"No one is joining for the party"</code> is expected as an output;</li>
	<li>Otherwise, take the friends' names as input, iteratively;</li>
	<li>Store them in a dictionary initialized with zeros;</li>
	<li>Print out the dictionary. </li>
</ol>

<p>To communicate with the user, please use the prompts specified in the examples. Note that here and in the following stages we expect you to take every input in a new line.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>Valid input</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter the number of friends joining (including you):
&gt; 5

Enter the name of every friend (including you), each on a new line:
&gt; Marc
&gt; Jem
&gt; Monica
&gt; Anna
&gt; Jason

{'Marc': 0, 'Jem': 0, 'Monica': 0, 'Anna': 0, 'Jason': 0}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2: </strong><em>Invalid input</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter the number of friends joining (including you):
&gt; 0

No one is joining for the party</code></pre>
