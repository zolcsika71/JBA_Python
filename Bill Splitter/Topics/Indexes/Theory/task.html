  <p>There are several types of collections to store data in Python. Positionally ordered collections of elements are usually called <strong>sequences</strong>, and both lists and strings belong to them. Each element in a list, as well as each character in a string, has an <strong>index</strong> that corresponds to its position. Indexes are used to access elements within a sequence. Indexing is <em>zero-based</em>, so if you see a person who counts from zero, you must have met a programmer.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Indexes of elements</h2> 
  <p>To access an element of a list by its index, you need to use <strong>square brackets. </strong>You add the brackets after the list and, between them, you write the index of an element you want to get.</p> 
  <p>Don't forget<strong>, </strong> the indexes start at 0, so the index of the first element is 0. The index of the last element is equal to <code class="language-python">len(list) - 1</code>.</p> 
  <p>Let's take a look at the example below:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']

first_elem = colors[0]   # 'red'
second_elem = colors[1]  # 'green'
third_elem = colors[2]   # 'blue'</code></pre> 
  <p>Strings work in the same way:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">pet = "cat"

first_char = pet[0]   # 'c'
second_char = pet[1]  # 'a'
third_char = pet[2]   # 't'</code></pre> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Potential pitfalls</h2> 
  <p>When using indexes, it's important to stay within the range of your sequence: you'll get an error (called <code class="language-python">IndexError</code>) if you try to access an element with a non-existing index!</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
pet = "cat"

print(colors[3])  # IndexError: list index out of range
print(pet[3])     # IndexError: string index out of range</code></pre> 
  <p>There is one more obstacle in your way. Imagine that you want to change one of the elements in a list. It can be easily done:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']

colors[1] = 'white'
print(colors)  # ['red', 'white', 'blue']</code></pre> 
  <p>However, when it comes to strings, such reassignment is impossible. Strings, unlike lists, are immutable, so you can't modify their contents with indexes:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">pet = "cat"

pet[0] = "b"
# TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment</code></pre> 
  <p>Don't worry, after some practice, you will not encounter these errors.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Negative indexes</h2> 
  <p>The easier way to access the elements at the end of a list or a string is to use <strong>negative indexes</strong>: the minus before the number changes your perspective in a way and you look at the sequence from the end. So, the last element of a list, in this case, has the index equal to <strong>-1</strong>, and the first element of the list has the index <code class="language-python">-len(list)</code> (the length of the list).</p> 
  <p>For example:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']

last_elem = colors[-1]    # 'blue'
second_elem = colors[-2]  # 'green'
first_elem = colors[-3]   # 'red'

pet = "cat"

last_char = pet[-1]    # 't'
second_char = pet[-2]  # 'a'
first_char = pet[-3]   # 'c'</code></pre> 
  <p>As you can see, it works the same for lists and strings.</p> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
   If you write a non-existing negative index, you'll also get 
   <code class="language-python">IndexError</code>. Be careful with indexes to avoid off-by-one errors in your code.
  </div>

  <p>Since you have learned the concept of indexes, we hope that from now on you will not encounter any difficulties when using them!</p>
