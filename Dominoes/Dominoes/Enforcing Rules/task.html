<h2>Description</h2>

<p>You can't have a game without rules. It's time to introduce them!</p>

<p>Until now, the players were able to place their dominoes however they like. Now, it is considered a violation. According to the rules, the numbers on the ends of the two neighboring dominoes must match each other. This rule can also be described as a set of two requirements:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A player cannot add a domino to the end of the snake if it doesn't contain the matching number.</li>
	<li>The orientation of the newly added domino ensures that the matching numbers are neighbors.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, consider the following situation:</p>

<p>We have a <code class="java">[3,4],[4,4],[4,2]</code> snake and a <code class="java">[1,2]</code> domino. The domino cannot be added to the left side of the snake because there is no 3 in <code class="java">[1,2]</code>. However, the domino can be added to the right side of the snake because <code class="java">[1,2]</code> contains a 2. If we were to place the domino on the right side of the snake, we would have to reorient it: <code class="java">[3,4],[4,4],[4,2],<strong>[2,1]</strong></code>.<br>
<br>
These two requirements are strict for both the player and the computer.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Add the following functionality to your code. When it's a player's turn, the program should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Verify that the move entered by the player is legal (requirement #1).<br>
	If not, request a new input with the following message: <code class="java">Illegal move. Please try again.</code>.</li>
	<li>Place dominoes with the correct orientation (requirement #2).</li>
</ol>

<p>When it's a computer's turn, the program should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Try random moves until it finds a legal one.<br>
	<div class="alert alert-primary">A set of possible moves ranges from <code class="java">-computer_size</code> to <code class="java">computer_size</code> (where the <code class="java">computer_size</code> is the number of dominoes the computer still has). Skipping a turn (move 0) is always legal.</div></li>
	<li>Place dominoes with the correct orientation.</li>
</ol>
