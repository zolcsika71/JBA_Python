  <h2>Defining a lambda function</h2> 
  <p>Imagine that you want to write a function that takes a number and doubles it. If you already know how to define functions in Python using the <strong>def </strong>keyword, you will probably write something like this:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">def doubler(x):
    return 2 * x</code></pre> 
  <p>Well, there is actually another way to define such small functions in Python using the <strong>lambda </strong>keyword. The following function is completely equivalent to the one defined above:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">lambda x: 2 * x</code></pre> 
  <p>This function doesn't have a name and is, therefore, called <strong>anonymous</strong>. Since in Python anonymous functions are declared with the <strong>lambda</strong><strong> </strong>keyword, they are often referred to as<strong> lambda functions</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Let's take a look at the syntax in its general form:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">lambda arguments: expression</code></pre> 
  <p>A lambda function can take any number of arguments separated by commas, but it must consist of a <em>single </em>expression. This expression is evaluated and the result is returned. Note that you do not need the <strong>return</strong> statement here. For example, the following anonymous function computes the remainder of the division of the sum of two numbers by two:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">lambda x, y: (x + y) % 2</code></pre> 
  <p>In case you want to put a condition in some lambda function, you'll have to use the so-called ternary operator <code class="language-python">first_alternative if condition else second_alternative</code>:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python"># Yes
lambda x: 'even' if x % 2 == 0 else 'odd'

# No
lambda x:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return 'even'
    else:
        return 'odd'</code></pre> 
  <p>Classic conditional statements will not work within a lambda function.</p> 
  <h2>Invoking a lambda function</h2> 
  <p>Alright, but how do we call such a function if it does not have a name?</p> 
  <p>Python syntax allows us to do so by enclosing the function in brackets and passing arguments right away:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">(lambda x, y: (x + y) % 2)(1, 5)
# The output is 0</code></pre> 
  <p>Alternatively, it is also possible to assign a function object to a variable:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">func = lambda x, y: (x + y) % 2
func(1, 10)
# The output is 1</code></pre> 
  <p>However, assigning an anonymous function does not comply with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">official style guidelines</a>. It's reasonable to declare your function explicitly with the <strong>def</strong> keyword in case you want it to have a name.</p> 
  <h2>When is it useful?</h2> 
  <p>You might have noticed already that the function from our example above is fully equivalent to a 'normal' function defined as follows:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">def my_func(x, y):
    return (x + y) % 2</code></pre> 
  <p>But if we can always use a normal function instead, why are lambda functions useful? </p> 
  <p>Well, lambda functions are handy, for example, when you use them in combination with another function. Take a look at the following example:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">def create_function(n):
    return lambda x: n * x</code></pre> 
  <p>The function <code class="language-python">create_function</code> takes one argument, number <em>n</em>, and returns a function that multiplies any given number <em>x</em> by that <em>n</em>. You can use it further in your program to quickly define a bunch of functions, for example:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python"># Creating a function that doubles its argument
doubler = create_function(2)

# This function will triple its argument
tripler = create_function(3)

doubler(2)
# Outputs 4

tripler(2)
# Outputs 6</code></pre> 
  <p>As you can see, the functions <code class="language-python">doubler()</code> and <code class="language-python">tripler()</code> are designed rather uniformly: they take a single argument and return it multiplied by <em>2</em> and <em>3</em> respectively. Thus, lambda functions can be embedded into a larger function, like <code class="language-python">create_function()</code> in our example.</p> 
  <h2>Conclusions</h2> 
  <p>Let's go over the main points we discussed:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li> <p><strong>Anonymous functions</strong> are functions defined without a name.</p> </li> 
   <li> <p>You can use the <strong>lambda </strong>keyword to define anonymous functions in Python.</p> </li> 
   <li> <p>A lambda function can only contain a single expression.</p> </li> 
   <li> <p>Lambda functions are particularly handy for one-time use, or when combined with other functions.</p> </li> 
  </ul>
