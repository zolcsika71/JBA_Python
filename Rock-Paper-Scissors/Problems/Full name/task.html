<h2>Full name</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>In the code below, you can see a program that creates a full name from the first and last names for several people. </p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">name1 = "John"
last_name1 = "Lennon"
full_name1 = name1 + " " + last_name1
        
name2 = "Hermione"
last_name2 = "Granger"
full_name2 = name2 + " " + last_name2</code></pre> 
  <p>Wouldn't it be much easier if we had a function that could do the same?</p> 
  <p>Your task is to write the body of the function <code class="language-python">create_full_name</code> that takes <code class="language-python">name</code> and <code class="language-python">last_name</code> (in this order) and <strong>returns</strong> the full name. </p> 
  <p>Do NOT change the variable names. You don't need to call the function yourself. </p>
