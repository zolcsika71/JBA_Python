<h2>Something in common</h2>

  <p>In the code template below you can see two functions that represent different mathematic processes. However, there is a line of code repeated in both these functions. Since this part of code does the same thing in both functions, it can be moved from these functions into another separate function. </p> 
  <p>Find this line of code and create a function with it. Name this function <code class="java">common_part</code>. </p> 
  <p>You do NOT need to work with the input or call any functions.</p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-546').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-546" style="display:none;">
   Don't forget that your function should also have an argument. 
  </div>
