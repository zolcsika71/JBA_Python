  <p>In nuclear physics, the half-life is used to describe the rate with which elements undergo radioactive decay. More precisely, it is the time required for an element to reduce in half.</p> 
  <p>Let's take an isotope of Radium (Ra) called radium-223. Its half-life is about <strong>12</strong> days: this means that every 12 days the number of atoms reduces in half.</p> 
  <p>Your program should:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>read the initial and the final quantity of atoms from the input</li> 
   <li>count how many complete half-life periods would it take for the initial number of atoms of radium-223 to <strong>go below</strong> the final quantity. Note that the number of half-life periods should be an <strong>integer</strong>, not a <strong>float</strong>!</li> 
   <li>multiply the number of half-life periods by 12 to convert the number of half-life periods to days</li> 
   <li>output the resulting number of days that it takes for the initial number of atoms to go below the final number</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>For example, the initial number of atoms is 4 and the resulting quantity is 3. After the first half-life period, the initial number will reduce to 2 atoms, which is <strong>below </strong>3. Then, we take the number of half-life periods that have passed (1) and multiply it by the number of days that every half-life period takes (12). The output will be 12. </p> 
  <p><strong>The input format:</strong></p> 
  <p>The first line: the initial quantity of atoms (from 2 to 1,000,000).</p> 
  <p>The second line: the final quantity of atoms.</p> 
  <p><strong>The output format:</strong></p> 
  <p>The number of <strong>days </strong>that it would take for radium-223 to go from the initial quantity of atoms<strong> below</strong> the final quantity of atoms.</p> 
  <p><strong>An example:</strong></p> 
  <p>The initial quantity is 8, the final quantity is 4. Your program output should be number 24. </p>
